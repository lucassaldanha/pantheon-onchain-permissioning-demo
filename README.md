# Pantheon Onchain Permissioning Management Dapp

After following these instruction you will have a network with three nodes running with onchain nodes and accounts permissioning enabled.

This demo has been tested with Pantheon 1.1.3 and with the commit 27dbc38 of the Permissioning Smart Contracts project.

## Requirements
1. Java (8+), Node (8.10+) and yarn (v.1.15+)
1. Chrome with Metamask installed (https://metamask.io/)
1. Truffle installed (https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation)
1. Pantheon installed (https://pantheon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/Install-Binaries/)
1. Permissioning Smart Contracts project checked out and ready to be used (https://github.com/PegaSysEng/permissioning-smart-contracts)
1. This repository checked out! :)

## Starting up the first node
1. Run the script `node0` to start the first node
1. Wait until the node is up and running

## Configuring Metamask
1. Open Chrome and click on the Metamask button
1. Select the network `Localhost 8545`
1. Click on Metamask account selector and choose **Import account**
1. Copy the private key for account `0xfe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73` from the provided genesis file
	```
	8f2a55949038a9610f50fb23b5883af3b4ecb3c3bb792cbcefbd1542c692be63
	```
1. Paste the private key in the designated field on Metamask and click **Import**
1. This account will be your first admin account. It is recommended that you name it `Network Admin` (or anything easy to remember)

## Deploying all permissioning smart contracts
1. Navigate to the Permissioning Smart Contracts project directory
1. If this is the first time you are compiling and deploying the contracts, run `yarn install`
1. Create a `.env` file with the following content:
    ```
    PANTHEON_NODE_PERM_ACCOUNT="0xfe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73"
    PANTHEON_NODE_PERM_KEY="8f2a55949038a9610f50fb23b5883af3b4ecb3c3bb792cbcefbd1542c692be63"
    PANTHEON_NODE_PERM_ENDPOINT="http://127.0.0.1:8545"
    NODE_INGRESS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x0000000000000000000000000000000000009999"
    ACCOUNT_INGRESS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0x0000000000000000000000000000000000008888"
    NETWORK_ID=2018
    INITIAL_WHITELISTED_NODES=enode://62f4dcdc43e29e9f9ed9cf2e3899c96fc180679279b3811b81ed38c403295832265d0563c8a0555348bbe9bc978151cb834ff99fed3550ca7de18a0b71ba6454@127.0.0.1:30303,enode://c783fc2f119bf2c79708b2e5f850bd53ac8d468ff6dfd32b7fcf95a8d7c1f514182030482f800ca9834f59c73a25e8659bf87bdfb8ae3cca6ed29ef1f3c81d91@127.0.0.1:30301,enode://bc628f93bbd110e69ed48a971c22bfb9e136627de46f446bf78c7eaca2a6493e3fa6c10b774575317f0b39333a083bf662c41d02228483c71978c3e7025fe678@127.0.0.1:30302
	INITIAL_WHITELISTED_ACCOUNTS=0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57
    ```
1. Run `truffle migrate --reset`
1. Wait until truffle finishes deploying all the permissioning contracts

## Starting the Pantheon Permissioning Management Dapp
1. Navigate to the Permissioning Smart Contracts project directory (if you aren't already in it)
1. Run `yarn start`
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
1. Double check that your Metamask is connected to your local node (`http://localhost:8545`)
1. You should be able to see the Whitelisted Accounts tab with accounts whitelisted (your account `0xfe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73` and any other accounts that you specified on `INITIAL_WHITELISTED_ACCOUNTS`)

## Creating nodes permissioning rules for other nodes
1. Navigate to the **Whitelisted Nodes** tab
1. You should be able to see rules for each one of the nodes that you specified on `INITIAL_WHITELISTED_NODES`
1. To create a new node permissioning rule, click on the **Add Whitelisted Node** button, add the enode URL of the node and click 'Add Whitelisted Node'

## Starting the other two nodes
1. In a new terminal window, navigate to our demo repository and run the script `node1`
1. In a new terminal window, navigate to our demo repository and run the script `node2`
1. Both nodes should be able to join the network. Check the logs to verify that they are importing the blocks generated by the first node

## Cleaning up
1. If you want to delete your chain and start over, just run the `purge` script. It will delete the database of the nodes without deleting their keys.
